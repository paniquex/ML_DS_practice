## Also in folder `MMRO` you could find tasks about Data Analysis. Some examples of task, which was solved:
1. Some typical preprocessing with pandas
1. A lot of data visualizations with matplotlib + seaborn (for example: visualization of SVC hyperplane, bias and variance of RandomForest, LinearRegression, DecisionTree, etc..)
1. Realization of KNNRegressor
1. Different metrics between categorical features:
  * Overlap indicator
  * Goodall (flattened overlap)
  * LogOverlap
5. Different preprocessing for categorical features:
  * Counters
  * Successes
  * Flattened counters and sucesses
  * etc..
6. Analysis of Linear Regression model
7. Constructing and plotting calibration curve of algorithms
8. Working with **VowpalWabbit** library
9. Realization of calculation bias, variance and error of algorithms with bootstrap
10. Using Bayes opt library
